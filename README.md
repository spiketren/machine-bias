### Deep Learning Model:

Required packages in Python 3: tensorflow (or tensorflow-gpu) & keras

Run model_train.py for training and model_test.py for testing.

A pre-trained model described in the article can be downloaded from http://mil.psy.ntu.edu.tw/machine-bias/model_450faces.h5 .

### Facial Symmetry:

Run face_symmetry.m in Matlab or Octave (+ octave-image) to get a symmetry score for each face image.

The Figure 2 in the article was generated from the data in symmetry_beauty.csv.
